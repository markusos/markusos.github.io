A little more than a month ago I left almost everything back in Sweden to go to the US for an internship at a digital agency called [Engage](http://enga.ge/) in Washington, DC. Even though I've just been here for a month I have already learned a lot, both new cool tools and frameworks like [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/), and also a great deal about life as an agency developer.

I'm gonna use this site to share my experiences and some of the things that I learn during my adventures here in the US.
