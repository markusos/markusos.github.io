**Hi everyone!**

A little more than a month ago I left almost everything back in Sweden to go to the US for an internship at a digital agency called [Engage](http://enga.ge/) in Washington, DC. Even though I've just been here for a month I have already learned a lot, both new cool tools and frameworks like [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/), and also a great deal about life as a agency developer.

My second week at Engage I was invited to join the rest of Engage's developers at the [PHP[World]](http://world.phparch.com/) conference here in DC. The conference was great, with many interesting and inspiring talks. One of my most memoreble experiences from the conferance was the dinner with the creator of the Laravel framework, Taylor Otwell, and the Capital Laravel Meetup group.
