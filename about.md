## About Me

Detail oriented full stack software engineer with 7+ years experience of building high-volume data systems. Lead Developer on CipherHealth's Digital Rounding product that was awarded as Best in KLAS 2019.

The web has always fascinated me, so from an early age I started coding web pages and writing software. This led me to pursue a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, from where I graduated in December 2013. Currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at CipherHealth.
