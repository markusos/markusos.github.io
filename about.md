##About Me

The web has always fascinated me, so from an early age I started coding web pages and writing software. This led me to pursue a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, from where I graduated in December 2013.

When I'm not working or hanging out with my friends I try to challenge myself to expand my knowledge of software development, from reading about new advancements in technology to learning new development tools and languages. On my GitHub page I collect some of the small projects that I've been working on, but also some larger projects like my master thesis project. Feel free to look through my GitHub projects, and to contact me via email for any questions or if you would like to talk to me about work opportunities.
