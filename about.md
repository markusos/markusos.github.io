## About Me

The web has always fascinated me, so from an early age I started coding web pages and writing software. This led me to pursue a Master’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, from where I graduated in December 2013.

When I'm not working or hanging out with my friends I try to challenge myself to expand my knowledge of software development, from reading about new advancements in technology to learning new development tools and languages. On my GitHub page I collect some of the small projects that I've been working on, but also some larger projects like my master thesis project.

## Technical Skills
Java, Ruby, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Linux, Algorithms, Computer Science, Web Development, Problem Solving, Computer Security
